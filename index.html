      /******************************************************
       * This is a mostly-empty repo, with a file that creates some data that
       * represents twitter users and their tweets. It's the data you would expect
       * to see if you had created a twitter account and followed a few people.
       * (More tweets appear over time.)

       That file is called data_generator.js. You don't need to understand the code
       that's in it, but here's what it does:

       Creates two global variables, users and streams.
       users is an array of strings -- all the usernames that you're following.
       streams is an object with two properties, users and home.
       streams.home is an array of all tweets from all the users you're following.
       streams.users is an object with properties for each user. streams.users.shawndrost
       has all of shawndrost's tweets.
       Kicks off a periodic process that puts more data in streams.
       You'll mostly be working in the javascript block of index.html.
       Note: The generated tweets will be displayed in reverse chronological order.

       Basic Requirements:

       1. Show the user new tweets somehow. (You can show them automatically as they're
            created, or create a button that displays new tweets.)
       2. Display the timestamps of when the tweets were created.
       3. Design your interface so that you want to look at and use the product you're making.
       4. Allow the user to click on a username to see that user's timeline.
